This project focuses on analyzing credit card transactions to detect and prevent fraudulent activities. With the increasing prevalence of online transactions, credit card fraud has become a significant concern for both financial institutions and consumers. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to identify fraudulent transactions accurately and efficiently.

**Key Features:**

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and identify any patterns or anomalies that may indicate fraudulent behavior.

Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Training: Train machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, or Gradient Boosting, to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a production environment to enable real-time fraud detection for credit card transactions.

**Technologies Used:**

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
